Learn Together :
======================================================================
This project is aimed to develop an online protal to share projects and

ideas within an institution. 

Any student of institution who wants to share idea to build or

develop some individual or group project can regester with

appropreate details and shre the idea to find help or other students

interested in working on that idea.


###Why intra-institution ?
======================================================================

Students get some ideas to solve real world problems but can't be confident to

implement it in real working models or can't get appropriate resources and support.

There are many ways now a day to learn , build and showcase but we feel

comfortable in sharing our ideas and works with our knowns or colleagues so a

network to help communicate, share ideas, works and collaborative learning within

our knowns or college is needed. This project focuses on providing a social platform

to improve collaborative learning within colleges, universities or schools.




###Framework
==========================================================================

`It is a expressjs based server side rendering, jquery single page app with proper routing.`

##How it works 

  * express server consumes Rest API from api server and translates data to desired schema.
  * server renders the partials to client , the jquery app at browser take care of appending partials.
  * For partial updates partials on ajax request from jquery app are sent in json and then appended in dome elements where required.
  * app seems to be an angular app and writing partials and jquery components is in same way as reactjs if merged together.
  * A highly scalable , easy to understand and develop, frame work.
  * All the business logic is separate (at api) and this micro-service can be used to do some server side tasks like static file serving, image manipulations etc.
